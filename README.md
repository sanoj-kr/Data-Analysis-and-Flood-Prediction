# 🌊Flood : Analysis & Prediction

This project aims to leverage data analysis and linear regression
techniques to analyze historical flood data and predict future
flood events. By identifying patterns and relationships in the
data, the project seeks to provide actionable insights for early
warning systems and disaster preparedness.




## 🛠 Skills
Jupyter Notebook, Python, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Visualisation.


## 🌟Features

- Flood Data Analysis
- Flood Data Visualizations
- Flood Prediction Through Regression Model


## 👀 PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Flooding poses a severe threat to communities worldwide, leading to devastating consequences. Despite advancements in technology and meteorology, accurately predicting flood events remains challenging due to the complex interplay of various climatic and environmental factors.
- This project addresses the need for a more reliable and data-driven approach to flood prediction, focusing on linear regression to model and forecast flood occurrences based on historical data and relevant predictors.

### ↗Steps ----

## 1. Data Collection 📦
### Data Sources
The dataset used in
this project is taken
from Kaggle. There are
several attributes in
the data set on which
we are analyzing,
visualizing and
predicting the flood

### Data Description
This dataset contains information on various factors that may
influence flood risk. The dataset includes several features
representing environmental, social, infrastructure, and
governance-related factors that could impact the likelihood
and severity of flooding events.

## 2. Data Preprocessing 💎
### Data Cleaning
For Data cleaning first we have
check null and duplicate values
present in dataset by
df.isna().sum() &
df.duplicated().sum() function.
remove the unusable
column by
df.drop('id',axis=1,inplace=True)
method
### Handling Missing Values
Missing values is replace by the
mean value of column
We have used method
df['MonsoonIntensity'].fillna(df['
MonsoonIntensity'].mean()) to
handle the missing values with
mean value.

## 3. Data Analysis 🔍
### Analytical Tools and Methods Used:
Python: For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, seaborn and matplotlib.
### Insights Derived:
- Conduct EDA to uderstand the distribution and relationship between variables.
- Visualize data using charts, graphs, and heatmaps to identify patterns and trends.
### Key Findings
- Select significant features based on domain knowledge and Statistical test.
- Create new feature through, transformation and aggregation and interaction term.

## 4. Data Visualization 📊
Data visualization helps in identification of significant factors contributing to flooding and their relative importance.

## 5. Model Building 💻
### Train the Model
We used the Linear Regression algorithm from the sklearn library to train our model. The model was trained on the training dataset, using various predictors that potentially influence flood probabilities.

### Testing
After training, the model was tested on the test dataset to evaluate its predictive performance. The predictions (y_pred_lr) were generated based on the features from the test set.

### Accuracy of Model
The model's accuracy was assessed using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the R² score. The MAPE indicated a relatively low error rate of 3.19%, suggesting that the predictions were generally close to the actual values. The R² score of 0.84 reflects a strong correlation between the predicted and actual values, indicating that the model explains 84% of the variance in the flood probability.

## 5. Model Predictions 🎯
### Prediction on New Test Data
In this step, the trained Linear Regression model was used to predict flood probabilities for new test data. The model generates a probability score for each record, indicating the likelihood of flooding.
The output predictions were saved in a CSV file (submission.csv) with two columns: id and FloodProbability. Each row represents an individual record with a unique ID and its corresponding predicted flood probability.

## Problem Outcomes ⭐✅
Accurate Predictive Model: A linear regression model capable of accurately predicting flood events based on historical data and key predictors.

Insightful Analysis: Identification of significant factors contributing to flooding and their relative importance.

Visualization Tools: Interactive dashboards and visualizations to help stakeholders understand flood risks and take proactive measures.

Policy Recommendations: Data-driven recommendations for improving flood management strategies, infrastructure planning, and community preparedness.

Enhanced Early Warning Systems: Improved accuracy and reliability of flood predictions, enabling timely warnings and reducing the impact of floods on communities.

## Conclusion ✍
This project aims to leverage the power of data analysis and linear regression to address the critical issue of flood prediction. By developing an accurate and reliable predictive model, the project seeks to enhance early warning systems, inform policy decisions, and ultimately reduce the devastating impact of floods on human lives and the environment. Through rigorous data collection, analysis, and visualization, the project will provide valuable insights and tools for better flood management and preparedness.
